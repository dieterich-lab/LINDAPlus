title: LINDA+
---

LINDA+ is a method used to identify intra- and inter-cellular interaction networks at a domain resolution, allowing to further study the effects of AS on signalling. It is a tool that integrates prior knowledge (PKN) of directed joint interactions (protein-protein and Domain-Domain intra-cellular interactions) as well as structurally resolved ligand-receptor pairs from various resources (list of resources when ready) with estimated transcription factor enzymatic activities based on sc-RNAseq reads and optionally abundances of secreted extra-cellular proteins from Secretomics data analysis.

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
